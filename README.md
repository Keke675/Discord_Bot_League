## Presentation & Introduction

Back in 2021, I used to play at **League of legends** (a lot) with my friends. We were in *competition* each other, we were checking winrates, rankgs, games win (or lose) from everyone in the group (we were 8-10 at this moment). To do that we were checking the website "_op.gg_" wich gave us a lot of informations.

But this solution was long and boring. So to make things a lot __spicier__ i wanted a tool that shows to everyone in the group who's the best and who's the worse player. We used _Discord_ as our **home** to play, talk, and post messages. 

And then i had the idea to make a discord bot who's actually going to fullfill the "_op.gg_" website but on discord !

## Technologies

For that project I used **Python**. The reason of why i chose Python ? In school we used to "code" in python so I was familiarized with it. Even if JavaScript might be better in the discord bot developpement

## Installation

At this moment the project isn't finished yet. Even if it is not finished, i decided to publish my work here.

In order to make the app work you have to follow these steps :

### 1. Download files in the same folder
